##Youtube Audio Extracter##

This particular repository consist of a small project where I eztract the audio and video from youtube videos using `pytube` and convert it to text using deepgram AI. After summarizing the text, I give it as an audio output through ElevenLabs AI.

The code is given in the file below. It was a orginally a google colab file with the link -  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19s8iZIlfQNmUaCs1qwJrD-nQtwnimd9S

Please add prs if can be done better as I get a better chance to learn.

Enjoy and Learn!!
